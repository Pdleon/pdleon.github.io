## Getting Certified !
<p align="justify">
I have known numerous incredible and talented people who have no interest in getting certified, some may think it doesn't reflect the real life experience in the trenches or real ability to understand and apply concepts. For some this is not a useful way to spend time learning by studying, but they rather have hands on experience.
For some, this is their path to different opportunities in their career development, to carry a unique set of skills and credentials validated by an entity like Microsoft in this case.

Getting certified in a specific area only means that you have put on the work to understand, to assimilate a well variety of concepts and techonology bits. 

For me, it's a well worth investment into a career development, to be able to merge  into a world of digital change and evolution

Stay tuned as I take on my journey to get my Azure Certification.  This blog post will be updated regularly with links, tips and useful resources.
